# BlackJack
One of my first games that I made.

I now would like to add better graphics to the game. i was thinking pygame but i dont know much about it, any help would be great. 
I would also like to add a data base for people to keep track of the winnings and losses. 

This is for myself and to build my knowledge of python.
